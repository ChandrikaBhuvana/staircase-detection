## ⚠️ Challenges and Limitations of Classic Detection Methods

### ❌ Poor Performance in Challenging Conditions

Traditional methods struggle under difficult scenarios such as:

- Low lighting environments  
- Irregular or complex architectural layouts  
- Occluded or obstructed views  

### 📉 Limitations of Depth Sensor Integration

While physical depth sensors can improve accuracy, they introduce notable drawbacks:

- Increased system complexity  
- Higher hardware costs  
- Frequent and intensive maintenance

## ✅ Our Contributions: Proposed Method Overview

> 🔍 **Introducing StairDepth** – a novel and efficient monocular-based depth estimation approach tailored for staircase detection.

- **Depth Estimation Without Sensors**  
  Our architecture estimates depth maps directly from RGB images—**no need for physical sensors**.

- **Robust Staircase Detection**  
  Accurately detects staircases by classifying:
  - **Stair lines** into **concave** or **convex**
  - **Surfaces** as **tread** or **riser**

  This enables **precise staircase localization**, even in complex environments.

## 📊 Performance Highlights

- **Stair Line Classification**  
  - Precision: **83.2%**  
  - Recall: **90.8%**  
  - IoU: **72.2%**  
  ➤ Outperforms existing methods in identifying stair edge geometry.

- **Stair Surface Classification**  
  - Pixel Accuracy: **97.1%**  
  - Mean Pixel Accuracy: **82.9%**  
  ➤ Demonstrates superior surface segmentation capability.
